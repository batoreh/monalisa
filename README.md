# monalisa
a engine of a paint tool with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.

You can use a live demo and save your draw [here](http://blog.netoguimaraes.com.br/monalisa).

But if you want to add this to some project, you can do it too. Follow the instructions below.



## Using in third party projects

The requisit to use it is to have a <code>canvas</code> element with the id setted to "screen" with a width and height defined in html tag. If you want to use the default configuration for the controls, you can past this code wherever you want to use the Monalisa. 

```html
<div class="canvas-container">
	<div class="controls">
		<div id='div-color' class="buttons">
			<input type="color" id="input-color" class="buttons" onchange="changeColor(this.value);">
		</div>
		<input type="range" min="1" max="40" id="input-width" onchange="changeWidth(this.value);">
		<input type ="button" name="clear" value="clear" id="clearCanvas" class="buttons"/>
		<input type="button" name="save" value="save" id="saveBtn" class="buttons" />
	</div>
	<canvas id="screen" class="canvas" width="900" height="600"> </canvas>
</div>
```

If you add the <code>builder.js</code> file and the <code>canvas.css</code> to your project, its already done. 

If you will use in production, I recommend you to implement something to handle with the url generated by "save" button. It saves the canvas in a base64 code, that can be too long sometimes and it could be a problem in some applications. 

## Contributing
