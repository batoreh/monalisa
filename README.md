# monalisa
a engine of a paint tool with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. 

You can use a live demo and save your draw [here](http://blog.netoguimaraes.com.br/monalisa). But if you want to add this to some project, you can do it too. Follow the instructions.

## Using in third party projects

The requisit to use it is to have a canvas element in your page with the id seted to "screen" with a width and height defined in html tag. If you add the <code>builder.js</code> file and the <code>canvas.css</code> to your project, its already done. If you will use in production, I recommend you toi implement something to handle with the url generated by "save" button. It saves the canvas in a base64 code, that can be too long sometimes and it could be a problem in some applications. 

## Contributing
