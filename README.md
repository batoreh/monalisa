# monalisa
a engine of a paint tool with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.

You can use a live demo and save your draw [here](http://blog.netoguimaraes.com.br/monalisa).

But if you want to add this to some project, you can do it too. Follow the instructions below.



## Using in third party projects

The requisit to use it is to have a <code>canvas</code> element with the id setted to "screen" with a width and height defined in html tag. If you want to use the default configuration for the controls, you can past this code wherever you want to use the Monalisa. 

```html
<div class="canvas-container">
	<div class="controls">
		<div id='div-color' class="buttons">
			<input type="color" id="input-color" class="buttons" onchange="changeColor(this.value);">
		</div>
		<input type="range" min="1" max="40" id="input-width" onchange="changeWidth(this.value);">
		<input type ="button" name="clear" value="clear" id="clearCanvas" class="buttons"/>
		<input type="button" name="save" value="save" id="saveBtn" class="buttons" />
	</div>
	<canvas id="screen" class="canvas" width="900" height="600"> </canvas>
</div>
```

If you add the <code>builder.js</code> file and the <code>canvas.css</code> to your project, its already done. 

If you will use in production, I recommend you to implement something to handle with the url generated by "save" button. It saves the canvas in a base64 code, that can be too long sometimes and it could be a problem in some applications. 

## Contributing

=======
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
